# Attendance Sorter
### Background and Description
Attendance Sorter is a Google Sheets add-on to help people manage attendance with Google Sheets and Forms. It grew out of the frustration of using Google Apps to collect attendace. Every time a user signed in to a form, a new timestamped row was added to the sheet resulting in a massive messy table. Accordingly, Attendance Sorter's original and primary function is to take raw form data and sort into a nice formatted sheet (example below)

#### Example Sheet

| First Name    | Last Name     |1/18/16|1/25/16|2/1/16|2/8/16|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|---|---|---|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |absent|attended|attended|
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |absent|attended|absent|
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |absent|absent|attended|

## Usage

### Methods of collecting attendance

1. Each student signs in to a google form at each meeting
