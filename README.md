### Background and Description
Attendance Sorter is a Google Sheets add-on to help people manage attendance with Google Sheets and Forms. It grew out of the frustration of using Google Apps to collect attendace. Every time a user signed in to a form, a new timestamped row was added to the sheet resulting in a massive messy table. Accordingly, Attendance Sorter's original and primary function is to take raw form data and sort into a nice formatted sheet (example below)

#### Example Sheet

| First Name    | Last Name     |1/18/16|1/25/16|2/1/16|2/8/16|
| :------------- |:-------------| -----|---|---|---|
| John | Doe |absent|attended|attended|attended|
| Zack | Green |absent|attended|absent|attended|
| Liza | Purple |absent|absent|attended|absent|

## Usage
